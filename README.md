# Functional Game Of Life #
Game of life using Java 8 streams and lambdas intensivelly

Hello!
This is my first attempt to achieve a functional version of the Game of Life of Conway using the new fantastic 
style of programming of Java 8, with Streams and lambdas.

All static methods, not so object oriented, but a good exercise to understand the power and beauty of Java 8.
I think that is posible to rewrite it without any sentence, only expressions. But I'm not shure.

Contact me if you have an idea to make it simpler, or better in any sense. (No, dont need graphics, please)

Cheers from Spain.
Antonio
